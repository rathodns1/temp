Hello Ranjit sir Good Afternoon,

We began system hardening yesterday, but we are currently unable to access W3 on the system. However, we must accomplish certification compulsorily in this month.
Please set up a brief meeting with me and others to discuss this & some queries listed below.

Discussion topic:
1. System Hardening 
2. Access to w3 after hardening
3. How to complete certification on hardened laptop
4. What will be the step by step process for this project?

Hello Tanmay Good Morning,

Ranjit Mohanty told me to contact you regarding Hyper-v training which we need to complete this month.
To access IBM w3 sites and fulfil certifications, we need to use hyper-v on our hardened laptop.
Please assist us with Hyper-v?
